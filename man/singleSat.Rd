\arguments{
\item{soundfile}{tuneR Wave object or path to a valid audio}

\item{channel}{channel where the background noise values will be extract from. Available channels are: \code{"stereo"}, \code{"mono"}, \code{"left"} or \code{"right"}. Defaults to \code{"stereo"}.}

\item{timeBin}{size (in seconds) of the time bin. Defaults to \code{60}.}

\item{dbThreshold}{minimum allowed value of dB for the spectrograms. Defaults to \code{-90}, as set by Towsey 2017.}

\item{targetSampRate}{sample rate of the audios. Defaults to \code{NULL} to not change the sample rate. This argument is only used to down sample the audio.}

\item{wl}{window length of the spectrogram. Defaults to \code{512}.}

\item{window}{window used to smooth the spectrogram. Defaults to \code{signal::hammning(wl)}. Switch to \code{signal::hanning(wl)} if to use hanning instead.}

\item{overlap}{overlap between the spectrogram windows. Defaults to \code{wl/2} (half the window length)}

\item{histbreaks}{breaks used to calculate Background Noise. Available breaks are: \code{"FD"}, \verb{"Sturges}", \code{"scott"} and \code{100}. Defaults to \code{"FD"}.
\if{html}{\out{<br>}}Can also be set to any number to limit or increase the amount of breaks.}

\item{powthr}{a single value to evaluate the activity matrix for Soundscape Power (in \%dB). Defaults to \code{10}.}

\item{bgnthr}{a single value to evaluate the activity matrix for Background Noise (in \%). Defaults to \code{0.8}}

Single Soundscape Saturation Index

\details{
Soundscape Saturation (\code{SAT}) is a measure of the proportion of frequency bins that are acoustically active in a determined window of time. It was developed by Burivalova et al. 2017 as an index to test the acoustic niche hypothesis.
To calculate this function, first we need to generate an activity matrix for each time bin of your recording with the following formula:

\deqn{a_{mf} = 1\  if (BGN_{mf} > \theta_{1})\  or\  (POW_{mf} > \theta_{2});\  otherwise,\  a_{mf} = 0,}

Where \eqn{\theta_{1}} is the threshold of BGN values and \eqn{\theta_{2}} is a threshold of dB values.
Since we define a single threshold for both in this function, we don't have to worry about generating a saturation value for many different combinations.
For the selected threshold a soundscape saturation measure will be taken with the following formula:

\deqn{S_{m} = \frac{\sum_{f = 1}^N a_{mf}}{N}}

Since this is analyzing the soundscape saturaion of a single file, no normality tests will be done.

\examples{

### Generating an artificial audio for the example
## For this example we'll generate a sweep in a noisy soundscape
library(tuneR)

# Define the audio sample rate, duration and number of samples
samprate <- 12050
dur <- 59

# Create a time vector
t <- seq(0, dur, by = 1/samprate)

# It starts at the frequency 50hz and goes all the way up to 4000hz
# The sweep is exponnential
freqT <- 50 * (4000/50)^(t/dur)

# Generate the signal
signal1 <- sin(10 * pi * cumsum(freqT) / samprate)
# We create an envelope to give the sweep a fade away
envelope <- exp(-4 * t / dur)
# Generating low noise for the audio
set.seed(413)
noise <- rnorm(length(t), sd = 0.3)
# Adding everything together in our signal
signal <- signal1 * envelope + noise

# Normalize to 16-bit WAV range to create our Wave object
signalNorm <- signal / max(abs(signal))
wave_obj <- Wave(left = signalNorm, samp.rate = samprate, bit = 16)

# Now we calculate soundscape saturation for our audio
# Here we are using timeBin = 10 so we get Soundscape Saturation values
# every 10 seconds on the audio
SAT <- singleSat(wave_obj, timeBin = 10)

# Now we can plot the results
# In the left we have a periodogram and in the right saturaion values
# along one minute
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
image(periodogram(wave_obj, width = 64), xlab = "Time (s)",
ylab = "Frequency (hz)", log = "y", axes = FALSE)
axis(1, labels = seq(0,60, 10), at = seq(0,7e5,length.out = 7))

type = "b", pch = 16, axes = FALSE)
axis(1, labels = paste0(c("0-10","10-20","20-30","30-40","40-50","50-59"),
